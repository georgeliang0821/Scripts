Computer Configuration\ Administrative Templates\ Windows Components\ Remote Desktop Services\ Remote Desktop Session Host\ Connections\

Restrict Remote Desktop Services users to a single Remote Desktop Services session     Disabled

Or you could edit the server's registry:

HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server

fSingleSessionPerUser     REG_DWORD     0x00000000
