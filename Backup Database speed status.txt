/*
                Backups are a great background performance test.  They run every night,
                they read a lot of data, they write a lot of data, and SQL Server tracks
                performance for us.  Let's trend backup data over time to see if it's
                getting better or worse overall.  You can compare these numbers against the
                other SQL Servers in your environment, but also be aware of where SQL is
                reading the data from and where it's being written.  If either of those is
                slow, it'll impact your backup performance.
