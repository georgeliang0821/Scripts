User Not Granted Logon Type Error
Product(s): Tableau Server
Version(s): All
Last Modified Date: 12 Dec 2013
When configuring Tableau Server during installation, you need to specify an account that the server can run as. By default the server uses the Network Service account. Alternatively, you can specify a specific user. Specific user names should be specified in the following format:
Domain\username

Sometimes if you've specified a specific "run-as" user you may encounter the following Logon failure error later during installation:

"Logon failure: the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer."

This error happens when the user account you specified does not have the right permissions that Tableau Server needs to run correctly. The "run-as" user needs to have the following permissions:

Access this computer from a network
Log on as a service
In some cases, depending on the complexity of the Microsoft security environment, the user account may need these additional privileges:

Act as part of the operating system
Allow logon through terminal services
Log on locally
Take ownership of files or other objects
Alternate Search Terms: Information Licenses and Installation run-as user
